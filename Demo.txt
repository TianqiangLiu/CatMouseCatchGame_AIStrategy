The best AI strategy is BFS and A* with my third heuristic function(Average of the distance from the cat to the mouse and the distance from the cat to the closest cheese).

I use three heuristics:
						1. the distance from the cat to the mouse
						2. the distance between the cat and the closest cheese from the mouse.
						3. the average.

The combination is better than individually. because they cover each others disadvantage.

If increase the size of the board to 30*30, I believe the A* strategy is becoming the best. The DFS will be very slow.

average moves: BFS:5
				DFS:8
				A*1:6
				A*2:6
				A*3:5
				
If increase the speed of the mouse, means it is difficult to catch the mouse. So it better to use BFS and A* to get optimal solution.
